## Download Files with Python

#### Simple project teached by [Programação Dinâmica](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qx2LGtKzjxk&feature=em-uploademail)

With this simple code it's possible download in a easily way many files in any format wanted.

In this code I specificly include the PDF type, but it's possible change.

```file_name = os.path.join(OUTPUT_DIR, 'Lecture_Notes_{}.pdf'.format(i))```

The URL can be changed too:

 ```BASE_URL = 'https://math.mit.edu/classes/18.745/Notes/Lecture_{}_Notes.pdf'```
